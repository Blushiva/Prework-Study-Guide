            <h4>HTML BASICS</h4>
            <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</li>
            <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
            <li>HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup</li>
            <h4>Elements</h4>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. 
                If there are three elements nested inside of a BODY element, 
                those three nested elements are known as child elements. 
                The element that holds all the children—in this case, the 
                BODY element—is known as the parent element. This 
                “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the
                relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
            <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in 
                the web development world, but it is important to
                know the difference. An element refers to the entire element 
                from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only
                to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent 
                the level of heading a given text block represents.
                Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more 
                prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. the h1 
                element is the biggest and they decrease in size.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph of text.</li>
            <li>The a element creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, 
                locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.</li>   
            <li>The img element embeds an image in the document.</li>
            <li>The ul element creates an unordered list.</li>
            <li>The ol element creates an ordered list.</li>
            <li>The li element creates a list item.</li>
            <li>The table element creates a table.</li>
            <li>The tr element creates a table row.</li>
            <li>The th element creates a table header cell.</li>
            <li>The td element creates a table data cell.</li>
            <li>The form element creates a form.</li>
            <li>The input element creates an input field.</li>
            <li>The button element creates a button.</li>
            <li>The label element creates a label for an input field.</li>
            <li>The select element creates a dropdown list.</li>
            <li>The option element creates an option in a dropdown list.</li>
            <li>The textarea element creates a multiline text input field.</li>
            <li>The div element creates a division or section in an HTML document.</li>
            <li>The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</li>
            <li>The header element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.</li>
            <li>The footer element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.</li>
            <li>The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.</li>
            <li>The aside element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content.</li>
            <li>The section element represents a generic section of a document or application.</li>
            <li>The article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.</li>
            <li>The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application.</li>
            <li>The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</li>
            <li>The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for a figure element.</li>
            <li>The audio element is used to embed sound content in documents.</li>
            <li>The video element is used to embed video content in documents.</li>
            <li>The source element specifies multiple media resources for the media elements, such as video and audio.</li>
            <li>The track element is used as a child of the media elements—audio and video. It 
                lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), 
                for example, to automatically handle subtitles.</li>
            <li>The canvas element provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly.</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the 
                webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src 
                attribute is the most important because it defines the location 
                of the image.  example: src="https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/prework/module-03/lesson-01/cute-pandas-02.jpg" </li>
            <li>The a element is an anchor used to create hyperlinks. </li>
            
            <h4>Attributes</h4>
            <li>The target attribute is optional. If it is not specified, the linked page will open in the same window or tab.</li>
            <li>The alt attribute is used to provide a text description of the image. 
                This is important for accessibility because screen readers will 
                read the alt text to visually impaired users. example: alt="Two cute pandas eating bamboo."</li>
            <li>The "a" (anchor) element can also be used to create internal links.
                Internal links are used to link to a specific section of the same page.
                To create an internal link, you need to use the id attribute to
                define the section you want to link to. example: a href="#section-id">Link text /a></li>
            <li>The href attribute is used to define the URL of the linked page. 
                example: href="https://www.google.com"</li>
            <li>The target attribute is used to define where the linked page will open.</li>
            <li>The target attribute can have the following values: _blank, _self, _parent, _top.</li>  
            <li>The _blank value opens the linked page in a new window or tab.</li>
            <li>The _self value opens the linked page in the same frame as it was clicked.</li>
            <li>The _parent value opens the linked page in the parent frame.</li>
            <li>The _top value opens the linked page in the full body of the window.</li>

            
            <li>The id attribute is used to define a unique identifier for an element.
                The id attribute is used to create internal links. 
                Internal links are used to link to a specific section of the same page. 
                To create an internal link, you need to use the id attribute to 
                define the section you want to link to. example: section id="section-id">Section content /section></li>
            <li>* The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.
            * The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
        <h4>FOOTER</h4>
            <li>Lastly, we have a "footer" element. The "footer" appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author,
                copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. In our case, we have a "p" element that renders "I can code!", as
                follows:</li>
        <h4>STYLE PROPERTY</h4>
        <li>HTMLElement: style property
        The read-only style property of the HTMLElement returns the inline style of an element in the form of a live
        CSSStyleDeclaration object that contains a list of all styles properties for that element with values assigned only for
        the attributes that are defined in the element's inline style attribute.
        
        Shorthand properties are expanded. If you set style="border-top: 1px solid black", the longhand properties
        (border-top-color, border-top-style, and border-top-width) are set instead.
        
        This property is read-only, meaning it is not possible to assign a CSSStyleDeclaration object to it. Nevertheless, it is
        possible to set an inline style by assigning a string directly to the style property. In this case the string is
        forwarded to CSSStyleDeclaration.cssText. Using style in this manner will completely overwrite all inline styles on the
        element.
        
        Therefore, to add specific styles to an element without altering other style values, it is generally preferable to set
        individual properties on the CSSStyleDeclaration object. For example, you can write element.style.backgroundColor =
        "red".
        
        A style declaration is reset by setting it to null or an empty string, e.g., elt.style.color = null.
        
        Note: CSS property names are converted to JavaScript identifier with these rules:
        
        If the property is made of one word, it remains as it is: height stays as is (in lowercase). As float is a reserved
        keyword in JavaScript, this property name was historically converted to cssFloat. All modern browsers now support the
        direct use of float in JavaScript to access the float CSS property, but cssFloat is used in older browsers and is still
        supported as an alias in modern browsers.
        If the property is made of several words, separated by dashes, the dashes are removed and it is converted to camel case:
        background-attachment becomes backgroundAttachment.
        The style property has the same priority in the CSS cascade as an inline style declaration set via the style attribute.</li>

        <h4>Document: createElement() method</h4>
        <li>
            In an HTML document, the document.createElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, or an
            HTMLUnknownElement if tagName isn't recognized.
        
            js
        
            createElement(tagName)
            createElement(tagName, options)
            tagName
            A string that specifies the type of element to be created. The nodeName of the created element is initialized with
            the
            value of tagName. Don't use qualified names (like "html:a") with this method. When called on an HTML document,
            createElement() converts tagName to lower case before creating the element. In Firefox, Opera, and Chrome,
            createElement(null) works like createElement("null").
        
            options Optional
            An object with the following properties:
        
            is
            The tag name of a custom element previously defined via customElements.define(). See Web component example for more
            details.
        
            The new Element.
        
            Note: A new HTMLElement is returned if the document is an HTMLDocument, which is the most common case. Otherwise a
            new
            Element is returned.
        
            This creates a new <div> and inserts it before the element with the ID "div1".
        </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section class="card" id="css-section">
          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <h3>Enter your CSS notes here</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            
          
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is applied to a single element using the style attribute.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is not recommended because it mixes content with presentation, making the code harder to maintain and update.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is used to style a single page. It is placed in the head section of the HTML file using the style element.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is not recommended because it mixes content with presentation, making the code harder to maintain and update.</li>
          <li>External CSS is used to style multiple pages. It is placed in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML file using the link element.</li>
          <li>External CSS is recommended because it separates content from presentation, making the code easier to maintain and update.</li>
          <li>The CSS syntax consists of a selector, property, and value.</li>
          <li>The selector is the HTML element that you want to style.</li> 
          <li>The property is the aspect of the element that you want to change.</li>
          <li>The value is the new setting for the property.</li>
          <li>For example, to change the color of the h1 element to red, you would use the following CSS code: h1 { color: red; }</li>
          <li>CSS properties can be grouped together using a comma.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property 
              we want to apply and the value of the property. For
              example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property 
              color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. 
              A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of 
              an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a 
              buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating 
              that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around
              the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is
              because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer
              outside an element.</li>
          <li>it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element,
              and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>Did you notice that the margin and padding properties are part of the declaration block for the * selector? Sometimes,
              we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. In
              this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set
              as 0:</li>
          <li>Let's add another CSS rule to our style sheet. This rule is for the header and footer selectors, as shown in the
              following code:
              header,
              footer {
              width: 100%;
              height: 120px;
              background-color: blue;
              color: white;
              }
              Notice that in the preceding rule, we combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the
              declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition,
              two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat
              Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
              <li>/* .card {
              width: 80%;
              margin: 40px auto;
              border: 5px solid gray;
              box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888;
              }*/ </li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain
              these property assignments from the CSS.
              The first declaration addresses the width of the element at 80% of the available width.
              The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.
              The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.
              The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by
              commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our
              example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box);
              the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread
              radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <h4>ELEMENT:setAttribute()method</h4>
        <li>Element: setAttribute() method
        The setAttribute() method of the Element interface sets the value of an attribute on the specified element. If the
        attribute already exists, the value is updated; otherwise a new attribute is added with the specified name and value.
        To get the current value of an attribute, use getAttribute(); to remove an attribute, call removeAttribute().
        If you need to work with the Attr node (such as cloning from another element) before adding it, you can use the
        setAttributeNode() method instead.
        
        js
        
        setAttribute(name, value)
        name
        A string specifying the name of the attribute whose value is to be set. The attribute name is automatically converted to
        all lower-case when setAttribute() is called on an HTML element in an HTML document.
        
        value
        A string containing the value to assign to the attribute. Any non-string value specified is converted automatically into
        a string.
        
        Boolean attributes are considered to be true if they're present on the element at all. You should set value to the empty
        string ("") or the attribute's name, with no leading or trailing whitespace. See the example below for a practical
        demonstration.
        
        Since the specified value gets converted into a string, specifying null doesn't necessarily do what you expect. Instead
        of removing the attribute or setting its value to be null, it instead sets the attribute's value to the string "null".
        If you wish to remove an attribute, call removeAttribute().
        
        InvalidCharacterError DOMException
        Thrown if the name value is not a valid XML name; for example, it starts with a number, a hyphen, or a period, or
        contains characters other than alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, or periods.
        
        In the following example, setAttribute() is used to set attributes on a <button>.
        
            html
        
            <button>Hello World</button>
            js
        
            const button = document.querySelector("button");
        
            button.setAttribute("name", "helloButton");
            button.setAttribute("disabled", "");
            This demonstrates two things:
        
            The first call to setAttribute() above shows changing the name attribute's value to "helloButton". You can see this
            using your browser's page inspector (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
            To set the value of a Boolean attribute, such as disabled, you can specify any value. An empty string or the name of
            the attribute are recommended values. All that matters is that if the attribute is present at all, regardless of its
            actual value, its value is considered to be true. The absence of the attribute means its value is false. By setting
            the value of the disabled attribute to the empty string (""), we are setting disabled to true, which results in the
            button being disabled. cited from Web MDN</li>
        <h4>Document: createElement() method</h4>
<li> 
In an HTML document, the document.createElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, or an
HTMLUnknownElement if tagName isn't recognized.

js

createElement(tagName)
createElement(tagName, options)
tagName
A string that specifies the type of element to be created. The nodeName of the created element is initialized with the
value of tagName. Don't use qualified names (like "html:a") with this method. When called on an HTML document,
createElement() converts tagName to lower case before creating the element. In Firefox, Opera, and Chrome,
createElement(null) works like createElement("null").

options Optional
An object with the following properties:

is
The tag name of a custom element previously defined via customElements.define(). See Web component example for more
details.

The new Element.

Note: A new HTMLElement is returned if the document is an HTMLDocument, which is the most common case. Otherwise a new
Element is returned.

This creates a new <div> and inserts it before the element with the ID "div1".

                <li>Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code.</li>
            <h4>COMMANDS for GIT</h4>
                <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
                <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
                <li>Types of GitHub Pages sites
            <h4>TYPES OF PUBLISHED GIT HUB</h4>   
                There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific
                project hosted on GitHub, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. User and organization sites are connected
                to a specific account on GitHub.com.
            <h4>HOW TO PUBLISH WEBPAGE/WEBSITE</h4>
                To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your personal account that's named <username>.github.io.
                    To publish an organization site, you must create a repository owned by an organization that's named <organization>
                        .github.io. Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at http(s)://
                        <username>.github.io or http(s)://<organization>.github.io.
                
                                The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project. Unless you're
                                using a custom domain, project sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository> or
                                        http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>.
</li>
                <li>Publishing from a branch
                
                Make sure the branch you want to use as your publishing source already exists in your repository.
                
                On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.
                
                Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click
                Settings.

                In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click Pages.
                
                Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select Deploy from a branch.
                
                Under "Build and deployment", use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source.

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <h3>Enter your JavaScript notes here</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <h4>JavaScript BASICS</h4>
            <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to add interactivity to web pages.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used to create web applications, games, and even server-side applications.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate
                images, and much more.</li>
            <li></li>
            <div>
            <h4>FUNCTIONS</h4>
            <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the
                JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. While
                that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily
                reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need. Being able to call a function to execute it also means you
                can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
            <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). Later on, we will define parameters that can be placed inside the
                parentheses. For now, just remember that it is important to include the parentheses whenever you write a function.
                </li>
                <li>   </li>
            <h4>VARIABLES</h4>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>To declare a variable in JavaScript, we have a few different options. Prior to more recent changes to JavaScript, we
                used the var keyword to create a variable in our code. You may see var from time to time, and it's a valid part of
                JavaScript, but it's important to note that all modern JavaScript uses new syntax, so we should avoid using var.</li>
            <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that
                variable will be, and once we declare it, we can never reassign it. When writing JavaScript, we always want to start by
                declaring variables using const. The second variable keyword we might use is let—more on that later.</li>
            <li>After the const keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the
                information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
            <li>After the name, we use the assignment operator, which is the equal sign (=). 
                This operator assigns the value on the right example: const shape = "circle";</li>
            <li></li>
                <h4>CONTROL FLOW</h4>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first
                statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. </li>
            <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. This means that we must be intentional about how we set up code
                in a JS file; we can’t just throw it all in there any which way!</li>
            <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code
                is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide
                is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition
                isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and
                move on.</li>
                <li></li>
            <h4>ARRAYS</h4>
            <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays
                must have multiple data types.</li>
            <li>Arrays are a type of data structure that allows us to store multiple items in a single variable.</li>
           <li>.map()</li>
            <li></li>
            <h4>for Loops</h4>
            <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
              <ol>* The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we
              declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the
              following line of code: let x = 0 </ol>
              <ol>* The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the
              loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length
              built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code: x (less than symbol) shapes.length; </ol>
              <ol>* The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we
              know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops,
              x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code: x++ </ol>
              <li>  </li>
              <h4>How would we convert a function to an arrow function</h4>
                <li>Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They are often used in modern JavaScript
                    development because they are easier to read and write. Arrow functions are anonymous functions, which means they do not
                    have a name. They are also always expressions, which means they always return a value. Arrow functions are defined using
                    the following syntax: const functionName = (parameter1, parameter2) => { return parameter1 + parameter2; };</li>
                <li>Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They are often used in modern Javascript</li>
                <li>
                    Let's decompose a traditional anonymous function down to the simplest arrow function step-by-step. Each step along the
                    way is a valid arrow function.
                    </li>
                    <li>Note: Traditional function expressions and arrow functions have more differences than their syntax. We will introduce
                    their behavior differences in more detail in the next few subsections.
                    </li>
                    <li>Traditional anonymous function
                     
                    (function (a) {
                    return a + 100;
                    });
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     1. Remove the word "function" and place arrow between the argument and opening body brace
                    (a) => {
                    return a + 100;
                    };
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    2. Remove the body braces and word "return" — the return is implied.
                    (a) => a + 100;
                    </li>

                    <li>3. Remove the parameter parentheses
                    a => a + 100;
                    In the example above, both the parentheses around the parameter and the braces around the function body may be omitted.
                    However, they can only be omitted in certain cases.
                    The parentheses can only be omitted if the function has a single simple parameter. If it has multiple parameters, no
                    parameters, or default, destructured, or rest parameters, the parentheses around the parameter list are required.
                </li>
                <li>    </li>
                The <em>forEach()</em> method of Array instances executes a provided function once for each array element.
                <li></li>
                <li><em><h4>What is the difference between the spread and rest operator?</h4></em></li>
                <li>Spread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax
                "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single
                element. <em>See rest parameters and rest property. </em> </li>
                <li><em>Spread syntax</em> can be used when all elements from an object or array need to be included in a new array or object, or
                should be applied one-by-one in a function call's arguments list. There are three distinct places that accept the spread
                syntax:</li>
                <ol>Function arguments list (myFunction(a, ...iterableObj, b))</ol>
                <ol>Array literals ([1, ...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6])</ol>
                <ol>Object literals ({ ...obj, key: 'value' })</ol>
                <li>See MDN- Spread Syntax -for more info</li>
                <li><em>Copying an array</em>
                
                You can use spread syntax to make a shallow copy of an array. Each array element retains its identity without getting
                copied.
                
                js
                
                const arr = [1, 2, 3];
                const arr2 = [...arr];
                
                arr2.push(4);
                
                
                Spread syntax effectively goes one level deep while copying an array. Therefore, it may be unsuitable for copying
                multidimensional arrays. The same is true with Object.assign() — no native operation in JavaScript does a deep clone.
                The web API method structuredClone() allows deep copying values of certain supported types. See shallow copy for more
                details.</li>
                <li><em>Overriding properties</em>
                When one object is spread into another object, or when multiple objects are spread into one object, and properties with
                identical names are encountered, the property takes the last value assigned while remaining in the position it was
                originally set.</li>
                <li><em>Object destructuring</em> is a useful JavaScript feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. Even
                better, object destructuring can extract multiple properties in a single statement, can access properties from nested
                objects, and can set a default value if the property doesn't exist. </li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Web APIs</h4>
           <li><h4>application programming interfaces, or APIs</h4> API's allow web developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications.
        An essential part of a developer's toolbox, APIs can help add a wide range of functionality to your code.</li> 
        <li>APIs are built directly into the browser. When a webpage is loaded in the browser, an object representation of the
        webpage (the Document Object Model, or DOM) is created. As a programming interface, the DOM allows us to use JavaScript
        to interact with HTML elements.</li>
        <h4>Window</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document
        loaded in that window.
        
        A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.
        
        A global variable, window, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.
        
        The Window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, objects, and constructors which are not necessarily
        directly associated with the concept of a user interface window. However, the Window interface is a suitable place to
        include these items that need to be globally available. Many of these are documented in the JavaScript Reference and the
        DOM Reference.
        
        In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own Window object; the global window seen by JavaScript code running
        within a given tab always represents the tab in which the code is running. That said, even in a tabbed browser, some
        properties and methods still apply to the overall window that contains the tab, such as resizeTo() and innerHeight.
        Generally, anything that can't reasonably pertain to a tab pertains to the window instead.
        
        Note that properties which are objects (e.g., for overriding the prototype of built-in elements) are listed in a
        separate section below.</li>
         </ul>
    <h4>DOM</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Document Object Model (DOM)
        The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of
        a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript, even though modeling
        HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the core JavaScript language.
        
        The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains
        objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style,
        or content.
        
        Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a
        document on the web. This guide will introduce the DOM, look at how the DOM represents an HTML document in memory and
        how to use APIs to create web content and applications.
        
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs
        can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way,
        programming languages can interact with the page.
        
        A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is
        the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented
        representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
        
        For example, the DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list of all the p element
            elements in the document:
        
            js
        
            const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
        
        
            alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
            All of the properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organized into
            objects. For example, the document object that represents the document itself, any table objects that implement the
            HTMLTableElement DOM interface for accessing HTML tables, and so forth, are all objects.
        
            The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together. The core DOM defines the entities describing any document
            and the objects within it. This is expanded upon as needed by other APIs that add new features and capabilities to
            the DOM. For example, the HTML DOM API adds support for representing HTML documents to the core DOM, and the SVG API
            adds support for representing SVG documents.</li>
            <li>Document: querySelectorAll() method
            
            The Document method querySelectorAll() returns a static (not live) NodeList representing a list of the document's
            elements that match the specified group of selectors.

            SyntaxError exception is thrown.
            
            Note that the HTML specification does not require attribute values to be valid CSS identifiers. If a class or id
            attribute value is not a valid CSS identifier, than you must escape it before using it in a selector, either by calling
            CSS.escape() on the value, or using one of the techniques described in Escaping characters. See Escaping attribute
            values for an example.
            
            Return value
            A non-live NodeList containing one Element object for each element that matches at least one of the specified selectors
            or an empty NodeList in case of no matches.
            
            Note: If the specified selectors include a CSS pseudo-element, the returned list is always empty.
            Exceptions
            SyntaxError DOMException
            Thrown if the syntax of the specified selectors string is not valid.

<h4>Node: appendChild() method</h4>
        <li>
        The appendChild() method of the Node interface adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent
        node.
        
        Note: If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, appendChild() moves it from its current
        position to the new position.
        
        If the given child is a DocumentFragment, the entire contents of the DocumentFragment are moved into the child list of
        the specified parent node.
        
        appendChild() returns the newly appended node, or if the child is a DocumentFragment, the emptied fragment.
        
        Note: Unlike this method, the Element.append() method supports multiple arguments and appending strings. You can prefer
        using it if your node is an element.
        
        aChild
        The node to append to the given parent node (commonly an element).
        
        HierarchyRequestError DOMException
        Thrown when the constraints of the DOM tree are violated, that is if one of the following cases occurs:
        
        If the parent of aChild is not a Document, DocumentFragment, or an Element.
        If the insertion of aChild would lead to a cycle, that is if aChild is an ancestor of the node.
        If aChild is not a DocumentFragment, a DocumentType, an Element, or a CharacterData.
        If the current node is a Text, and its parent is a Document.
        If the current node is a DocumentType and its parent is not a Document, as a doctype should always be a direct
        descendant of a document.
        If the parent of the node is a Document and aChild is a DocumentFragment with more than one Element child, or that has a
        Text child.
        If the insertion of aChild would lead to Document with more than one Element as child.
        If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, appendChild() moves it from its current position
        to the new position — there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other
        node. This means that a node can't be in two points of the document simultaneously. The Node.cloneNode() method can be
        used to make a copy of the node before appending it under the new parent. Copies made with cloneNode are not
        automatically kept in sync.
        
        appendChild() returns the newly appended node, instead of the parent node. This means you can append the new node as
        soon as it's created without losing reference to it:</li>
    <h4>setInterval() global function</h4>
    <li>The setInterval() method, offered on the Window and WorkerGlobalScope interfaces, repeatedly calls a function or
    executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.
    This method returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it later by calling
    clearInterval().
    </li>
    <li>js</li>
    <li>
    setInterval(code)
    setInterval(code, delay)
    
    setInterval(func)
    setInterval(func, delay)
    setInterval(func, delay, arg1)
    setInterval(func, delay, arg1, arg2)
    setInterval(func, delay, arg1, arg2, argN)
    </li>

    <li>func</li>
    <li>A function to be executed every delay milliseconds. The first execution happens after delay milliseconds.
    </li>
    <li>code</li>
    <li>An optional syntax allows you to include a string instead of a function, which is compiled and executed every delay
    milliseconds. This syntax is not recommended for the same reasons that make using eval() a security risk.
    </li>
    <li>delay Optional
    The time, in milliseconds (thousandths of a second), the timer should delay in between executions of the specified
    function or code. Defaults to 0 if not specified. See Delay restrictions below for details on the permitted range of
    delay values.</li>
    <li>
    arg1, …,argN Optional
    Additional arguments which are passed through to the function specified by func once the timer expires.
    
    The returned intervalID is a numeric, non-zero value which identifies the timer created by the call to setInterval();
    this value can be passed to clearInterval() to cancel the interval.
    
    It may be helpful to be aware that setInterval() and setTimeout() share the same pool of IDs, and that clearInterval()
    and clearTimeout() can technically be used interchangeably. For clarity, however, you should try to always match them to
    avoid confusion when maintaining your code.
    
    Note: The delay argument is converted to a signed 32-bit integer. This effectively limits delay to 2147483647 ms,
    roughly 24.8 days, since it's specified as a signed integer in the IDL.</li>
    <h4>EVENT TARGET:addEventListener()method</h4>
    <li>EventTarget: addEventListener() method
    Note: This feature is available in Web Workers.
    
    The addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified
    event is delivered to the target.
    
    Common targets are Element, or its children, Document, and Window, but the target may be any object that supports events
    (such as IDBRequest).
    
    Note: The addEventListener() method is the recommended way to register an event listener. The benefits are as follows:
    
    It allows adding more than one handler for an event. This is particularly useful for libraries, JavaScript modules, or
    any other kind of code that needs to work well with other libraries or extensions.
    In contrast to using an onXYZ property, it gives you finer-grained control of the phase when the listener is activated
    (capturing vs. bubbling).
    It works on any event target, not just HTML or SVG elements.
    The method addEventListener() works by adding a function, or an object that implements a handleEvent() function, to the
    list of event listeners for the specified event type on the EventTarget on which it's called. If the function or object
    is already in the list of event listeners for this target, the function or object is not added a second time.
    
    Note: If a particular anonymous function is in the list of event listeners registered for a certain target, and then
    later in the code, an identical anonymous function is given in an addEventListener call, the second function will also
    be added to the list of event listeners for that target.
    
    Indeed, anonymous functions are not identical even if defined using the same unchanging source-code called repeatedly,
    even if in a loop.
    
    Repeatedly defining the same unnamed function in such cases can be problematic. (See Memory issues, below.)
    
    If an event listener is added to an EventTarget from inside another listener — that is, during the processing of the
    event — that event will not trigger the new listener. However, the new listener may be triggered during a later stage of
    event flow, such as during the bubbling phase.</li>
<h4>KeyboardEvent</h4>
<li>KeyboardEvent objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard; each event describes a single interaction between
    the user and a key (or combination of a key with modifier keys) on the keyboard. The event type (keydown, keypress, or
    keyup) identifies what kind of keyboard activity occurred.

    Note: KeyboardEvent events just indicate what interaction the user had with a key on the keyboard at a low level,
    providing no contextual meaning to that interaction. When you need to handle text input, use the input event instead.
    Keyboard events may not be fired if the user is using an alternate means of entering text, such as a handwriting system
    on a tablet or graphics tablet.
</li>
<h4>Event: preventDefault() method</h4>
    <li>The preventDefault() method of the Event interface tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly
    handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be.
    
    The event continues to propagate as usual, unless one of its event listeners calls stopPropagation() or
    stopImmediatePropagation(), either of which terminates propagation at once.
    
    As noted below, calling preventDefault() for a non-cancelable event, such as one dispatched via
    EventTarget.dispatchEvent(), without specifying cancelable: true has no effect.</li>
    <h4>Event: stopPropagation() method</h4>
    <li>The stopPropagation() method of the Event interface prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing
    and bubbling phases. It does not, however, prevent any default behaviors from occurring; for instance, clicks on links
    are still processed. If you want to stop those behaviors, see the preventDefault() method. It also does not prevent
    propagation to other event-handlers of the current element. If you want to stop those, see stopImmediatePropagation().</li>
    <h4>STORAGE</h4>
    <li>The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or local storage. It
    allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data items.
    <li>
    To manipulate, for instance, the session storage for a domain, a call to Window.sessionStorage is made; whereas for
    local storage the call is made to Window.localStorage.</li>
    <li>
    Instance properties
    Storage.length Read only
    Returns an integer representing the number of data items stored in the Storage object.</li>
    <li>
    Instance methods</li>
    <ul>
    Storage.key()
    When passed a number n, this method will return the name of the nth key in the storage.</ul>
    <ul>
    Storage.getItem()
    When passed a key name, will return that key's value.</ul>
    <ul>
    Storage.setItem()
    When passed a key name and value, will add that key to the storage, or update that key's value if it already exists.</ul>
    
    Storage.removeItem()
    When passed a key name, will remove that key from the storage.
    
    Storage.clear()
    When invoked, will empty all keys out of the storage.
</li>
<h4>Using data attributes</h4>
<li>HTML is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not
have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements
without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, or extra properties on DOM.

The syntax is simple. Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute. Say you
have an article and you want to store some extra information that doesn't have any visual representation. Just use data
attributes for that:
</li>
<li>html

< article id="electric-cars" data-columns="3" data-index-number="12314" data-parent="cars" >
    …
</article>
Reading the values of these attributes out in JavaScript is also very simple. You could use getAttribute() with their
full HTML name to read them, but the standard defines a simpler way: a DOMStringMap you can read out via a dataset
property.

To get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note
that dashes are converted to camel case).

js

const article = document.querySelector("#electric-cars");



article.dataset.columns;
article.dataset.indexNumber;
article.dataset.parent;
Each property is a string and can be read and written. In the above case setting article.dataset.columns = 5 would
change that attribute to "5".

Note that, as data attributes are plain HTML attributes, you can even access them from CSS. For example to show the
parent data on the article you can use generated content in CSS with the attr() function:

css

article::before {
content: attr(data-parent);
}
You can also use the attribute selectors in CSS to change styles according to the data:

css

article[data-columns="3"] {
width: 400px;
}
article[data-columns="4"] {
width: 600px;
}
You can see all this working together in this JSBin example.

Data attributes can also be stored to contain information that is constantly changing, like scores in a game. Using the
CSS selectors and JavaScript access here this allows you to build some nifty effects without having to write your own
display routines. See this screencast for an example using generated content and CSS transitions (JSBin example).

Data values are strings. Number values must be quoted in the selector for the styling to take effect.

Do not store content that should be visible and accessible in data attributes, because assistive technology may not
access them. In addition, search crawlers may not index data attributes' values.

Custom attributes are also supported in SVG 2; see HTMLElement.dataset and data-* for more information.
