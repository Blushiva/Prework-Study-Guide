          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. 
                If there are three elements nested inside of a BODY element, 
                those three nested elements are known as child elements. 
                The element that holds all the children—in this case, the 
                BODY element—is known as the parent element. This 
                “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the
                relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
            <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in 
                the web development world, but it is important to
                know the difference. An element refers to the entire element 
                from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only
                to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent 
                the level of heading a given text block represents.
                Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more 
                prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. the h1 
                element is the biggest and they decrease in size.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph of text.</li>
            <li>The a element creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, 
                locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.</li>   
            <li>The img element embeds an image in the document.</li>
            <li>The ul element creates an unordered list.</li>
            <li>The ol element creates an ordered list.</li>
            <li>The li element creates a list item.</li>
            <li>The table element creates a table.</li>
            <li>The tr element creates a table row.</li>
            <li>The th element creates a table header cell.</li>
            <li>The td element creates a table data cell.</li>
            <li>The form element creates a form.</li>
            <li>The input element creates an input field.</li>
            <li>The button element creates a button.</li>
            <li>The label element creates a label for an input field.</li>
            <li>The select element creates a dropdown list.</li>
            <li>The option element creates an option in a dropdown list.</li>
            <li>The textarea element creates a multiline text input field.</li>
            <li>The div element creates a division or section in an HTML document.</li>
            <li>The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</li>
            <li>The header element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.</li>
            <li>The footer element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.</li>
            <li>The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.</li>
            <li>The aside element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content.</li>
            <li>The section element represents a generic section of a document or application.</li>
            <li>The article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.</li>
            <li>The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application.</li>
            <li>The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</li>
            <li>The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for a figure element.</li>
            <li>The audio element is used to embed sound content in documents.</li>
            <li>The video element is used to embed video content in documents.</li>
            <li>The source element specifies multiple media resources for the media elements, such as video and audio.</li>
            <li>The track element is used as a child of the media elements—audio and video. It 
                lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), 
                for example, to automatically handle subtitles.</li>
            <li>The canvas element provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly.</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the 
                webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src 
                attribute is the most important because it defines the location 
                of the image.  example: src="https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/prework/module-03/lesson-01/cute-pandas-02.jpg" </li>
            <li>The alt attribute is used to provide a text description of the image. 
                This is important for accessibility because screen readers will 
                read the alt text to visually impaired users. example: alt="Two cute pandas eating bamboo."</li>
            <li>The a element is an anchor used to create hyperlinks. </li>
            <li>The href attribute is used to define the URL of the linked page. 
                example: href="https://www.google.com"</li>
            <li>The target attribute is used to define where the linked page will open.</li>
            <li>The target attribute can have the following values: _blank, _self, _parent, _top.</li>  
            <li>The _blank value opens the linked page in a new window or tab.</li>
            <li>The _self value opens the linked page in the same frame as it was clicked.</li>
            <li>The _parent value opens the linked page in the parent frame.</li>
            <li>The _top value opens the linked page in the full body of the window.</li>
            <li>The target attribute is optional. If it is not specified, the linked page will open in the same window or tab.</li>
            <li>The "a" (anchor) element can also be used to create internal links. 
                Internal links are used to link to a specific section of the same page. 
                To create an internal link, you need to use the id attribute to 
                define the section you want to link to. example: a href="#section-id">Link text /a></li>
            <li>The id attribute is used to define a unique identifier for an element.
                The id attribute is used to create internal links. 
                Internal links are used to link to a specific section of the same page. 
                To create an internal link, you need to use the id attribute to 
                define the section you want to link to. example: section id="section-id">Section content /section></li>
            <li>* The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.
            * The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
            <li>Lastly, we have a "footer" element. The "footer" appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author,
                copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. In our case, we have a "p" element that renders "I can code!", as
                follows:</li>
            <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</li>
            <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
            <li>HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup</li>
