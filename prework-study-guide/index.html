          <ul>
            
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. 
                If there are three elements nested inside of a BODY element, 
                those three nested elements are known as child elements. 
                The element that holds all the children—in this case, the 
                BODY element—is known as the parent element. This 
                “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the
                relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
            <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in 
                the web development world, but it is important to
                know the difference. An element refers to the entire element 
                from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only
                to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent 
                the level of heading a given text block represents.
                Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more 
                prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. the h1 
                element is the biggest and they decrease in size.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph of text.</li>
            <li>The a element creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, 
                locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.</li>   
            <li>The img element embeds an image in the document.</li>
            <li>The ul element creates an unordered list.</li>
            <li>The ol element creates an ordered list.</li>
            <li>The li element creates a list item.</li>
            <li>The table element creates a table.</li>
            <li>The tr element creates a table row.</li>
            <li>The th element creates a table header cell.</li>
            <li>The td element creates a table data cell.</li>
            <li>The form element creates a form.</li>
            <li>The input element creates an input field.</li>
            <li>The button element creates a button.</li>
            <li>The label element creates a label for an input field.</li>
            <li>The select element creates a dropdown list.</li>
            <li>The option element creates an option in a dropdown list.</li>
            <li>The textarea element creates a multiline text input field.</li>
            <li>The div element creates a division or section in an HTML document.</li>
            <li>The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</li>
            <li>The header element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.</li>
            <li>The footer element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.</li>
            <li>The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.</li>
            <li>The aside element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content.</li>
            <li>The section element represents a generic section of a document or application.</li>
            <li>The article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.</li>
            <li>The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application.</li>
            <li>The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</li>
            <li>The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for a figure element.</li>
            <li>The audio element is used to embed sound content in documents.</li>
            <li>The video element is used to embed video content in documents.</li>
            <li>The source element specifies multiple media resources for the media elements, such as video and audio.</li>
            <li>The track element is used as a child of the media elements—audio and video. It 
                lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), 
                for example, to automatically handle subtitles.</li>
            <li>The canvas element provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly.</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the 
                webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src 
                attribute is the most important because it defines the location 
                of the image.  example: src="https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/prework/module-03/lesson-01/cute-pandas-02.jpg" </li>
            <li>The alt attribute is used to provide a text description of the image. 
                This is important for accessibility because screen readers will 
                read the alt text to visually impaired users. example: alt="Two cute pandas eating bamboo."</li>
            <li>The a element is an anchor used to create hyperlinks. </li>
            <li>The href attribute is used to define the URL of the linked page. 
                example: href="https://www.google.com"</li>
            <li>The target attribute is used to define where the linked page will open.</li>
            <li>The target attribute can have the following values: _blank, _self, _parent, _top.</li>  
            <li>The _blank value opens the linked page in a new window or tab.</li>
            <li>The _self value opens the linked page in the same frame as it was clicked.</li>
            <li>The _parent value opens the linked page in the parent frame.</li>
            <li>The _top value opens the linked page in the full body of the window.</li>
            <li>The target attribute is optional. If it is not specified, the linked page will open in the same window or tab.</li>
            <li>The "a" (anchor) element can also be used to create internal links. 
                Internal links are used to link to a specific section of the same page. 
                To create an internal link, you need to use the id attribute to 
                define the section you want to link to. example: a href="#section-id">Link text /a></li>
            <li>The id attribute is used to define a unique identifier for an element.
                The id attribute is used to create internal links. 
                Internal links are used to link to a specific section of the same page. 
                To create an internal link, you need to use the id attribute to 
                define the section you want to link to. example: section id="section-id">Section content /section></li>
            <li>* The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.
            * The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
            <li>Lastly, we have a "footer" element. The "footer" appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author,
                copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. In our case, we have a "p" element that renders "I can code!", as
                follows:</li>
            <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</li>
            <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
            <li>HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <h3>Enter your CSS notes here</h3>
          <ul>
            
          
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is applied to a single element using the style attribute.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is not recommended because it mixes content with presentation, making the code harder to maintain and update.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is used to style a single page. It is placed in the head section of the HTML file using the style element.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is not recommended because it mixes content with presentation, making the code harder to maintain and update.</li>
          <li>External CSS is used to style multiple pages. It is placed in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML file using the link element.</li>
          <li>External CSS is recommended because it separates content from presentation, making the code easier to maintain and update.</li>
          <li>The CSS syntax consists of a selector, property, and value.</li>
          <li>The selector is the HTML element that you want to style.</li> 
          <li>The property is the aspect of the element that you want to change.</li>
          <li>The value is the new setting for the property.</li>
          <li>For example, to change the color of the h1 element to red, you would use the following CSS code: h1 { color: red; }</li>
          <li>CSS properties can be grouped together using a comma.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property 
              we want to apply and the value of the property. For
              example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property 
              color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. 
              A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of 
              an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a 
              buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating 
              that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around
              the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is
              because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer
              outside an element.</li>
          <li>it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element,
              and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>Did you notice that the margin and padding properties are part of the declaration block for the * selector? Sometimes,
              we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. In
              this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set
              as 0:</li>
          <li>Let's add another CSS rule to our style sheet. This rule is for the header and footer selectors, as shown in the
              following code:
              header,
              footer {
              width: 100%;
              height: 120px;
              background-color: blue;
              color: white;
              }
              Notice that in the preceding rule, we combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the
              declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition,
              two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat
              Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
              <li>/* .card {
              width: 80%;
              margin: 40px auto;
              border: 5px solid gray;
              box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888;
              }*/ </li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain
              these property assignments from the CSS.
              The first declaration addresses the width of the element at 80% of the available width.
              The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.
              The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.
              The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by
              commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our
              example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box);
              the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread
              radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

                <li>Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code.</li>
                <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

                <li>Types of GitHub Pages sites
                
                There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific
                project hosted on GitHub, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. User and organization sites are connected
                to a specific account on GitHub.com.
                
                To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your personal account that's named <username>.github.io.
                    To publish an organization site, you must create a repository owned by an organization that's named <organization>
                        .github.io. Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at http(s)://
                        <username>.github.io or http(s)://<organization>.github.io.
                
                                The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project. Unless you're
                                using a custom domain, project sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository> or
                                        http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>.

          <ul>
            <li>FUNCTIONS</li>
            <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the
                JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. While
                that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily
                reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need. Being able to call a function to execute it also means you
                can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
            <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). Later on, we will define parameters that can be placed inside the
                parentheses. For now, just remember that it is important to include the parentheses whenever you write a function.
                </li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>To declare a variable in JavaScript, we have a few different options. Prior to more recent changes to JavaScript, we
                used the var keyword to create a variable in our code. You may see var from time to time, and it's a valid part of
                JavaScript, but it's important to note that all modern JavaScript uses new syntax, so we should avoid using var.</li>
            <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that
                variable will be, and once we declare it, we can never reassign it. When writing JavaScript, we always want to start by
                declaring variables using const. The second variable keyword we might use is let—more on that later.</li>
            <li>After the const keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the
                information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
            <li>After the name, we use the assignment operator, which is the equal sign (=). 
                This operator assigns the value on the right example: const shape = "circle";</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first
                statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. The following brief video will
                help us understand this concept:</li>
            <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. This means that we must be intentional about how we set up code
                in a JS file; we can’t just throw it all in there any which way!</li>
            <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code
                is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide
                is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition
                isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and
                move on.</li>
            <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays
                must have multiple data types.</li>
            <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
              <ol>* The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we
              declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the
              following line of code: let x = 0 </ol>
              <ol>* The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the
              loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length
              built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code: x (less than symbol) shapes.length; </ol>
              <ol>* The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we
              know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops,
              x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code: x++ </ol>
          </ul>
